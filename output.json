Usually, immediate relatives include spouses, parents, and unmarried children.\n\n2. **Consider Alternatives**: Since direct sponsorship isn\u2019t possible, consider if there are other ways she might become eligible. This might include other family members who can sponsor her, such as a parent of yours who is also her child.\n\n3. **Tourist Visa**: If a long-term stay isn't required immediately, consider applying for a B-2 Tourist Visa for her to visit temporarily. This doesn't confer permanent residency but allows her to visit for a short time.\n\n4. **Consultation**: Given the complexities of family immigration, it might be helpful to consult with an immigration attorney who can provide advice based on your specific situation and potentially identify any other available pathways.\n\nEach case can be unique, so it's important to explore all possible options thoroughly."}
