User: Hi, I'm an international student and I just got my internship. I'm planning on starting working. Is it legit that I can work in the States without CPT? Yeah, please advise me.
Assistant: As an international student on an F-1 visa in the United States, you typically need authorization like Curricular Practical Training (CPT) to legally work off-campus in an internship related to your field of study. CPT is designed for practical training that is integral to your curriculum, and it usually requires approval from your Designated School Official (DSO) and is noted on your I-20 form.

Working without the appropriate authorization can jeopardize your visa status, so it's important to ensure you have CPT or another type of work authorization, like Optional Practical Training (OPT), before starting your internship. Always consult with your school's international student office to ensure you're compliant with visa regulations.
