User: Hi, I'm an international student and I just got my internship. I'm planning on starting working. Is it legit that I can work in the States without CPT? Yeah, please advise me.
Assistant: As an international student on an F-1 visa, you must have Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization to legally work in the U.S. during your academic program. CPT is required for off-campus work that is an integral part of your studies, such as an internship related to your major.

Working without the necessary CPT authorization could jeopardize your visa status. It's crucial to discuss your internship with your Designated School Official (DSO) and obtain the required authorization before beginning work.

Assistant: No, as an international student on an F-1 visa in the U.S., you typically need Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization to legally work during your academic program, especially for internships related to your field of study. CPT must be approved by your school's Designated School Official (DSO) and documented in your SEVIS record before you start working.

Working without CPT or other necessary authorization can lead to serious consequences, including impacting your visa status. I strongly recommend discussing this with your DSO to ensure you have the proper authorization before starting your internship.
